The Total Money Makeover
Dave Ramsey

The Total Money Makeover Motto
If you will live like no one else, 
later you can live like no one else.

Saving without a mission is garbage. Your money needs to 
work for you, not lie around you.

For your own good, for the good of your family and your future, grow a backbone.
When something is wrong, stand up and say it is wrong, and don't back down.

Debt is not a tool
Myth: Debt is a tool and should be used to create prosperity.
Truth: Debt adds considerable risk, most often doesn't bring prosperity,
and isn't used by wealthy people nearly as much as we are led to believe.

Breaking Down the Envelope System
It's easy to overspend when you don't have a clear boundary line. The budget
tells you what that line is for each category, but when your gas money and
grocery money and entertainment money are all sitting in one big lump in your
bank account, one category can plow right past the line without you knowing.
That's why I recommend using the envelope system for some categories.
Say you budget $600 for food this month. Well, when you get paid, you take
that $600 out of the bank in cash--yes, actual cash--and put it in an envelope.
Write "FOOD" on the outside of that envelope. When you go to the store, take
your envelope and spend your cash.
