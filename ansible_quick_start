Ansible is an automation engine that allows for agentless system configuration and deployment

The real power of Ansible comes from its simplicity.

Ansible operates over SSH and runs Ansible modules on remote systems in order to complete tasks.

Ansible is typically installed on a single, lightweight control node where a list of host inventory files, as well as "playbooks", are kept.

The heavy lifting is generally performed on the remote host as that is where Ansible Modules are executed.

Ansible Installation and Configuration
In order to install Ansible, you must configure the EPEL repository on your system.
yum list epel-release
sudo yum install epel-release (if necessary)

Once the EPEL repository is configured, your package manager installs Ansible and manages the dependencies:
sudo yum install ansible

It is advisable to install some means of source control as well
sudo yum install git

/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg si the primary Ansible configuration file.

Notable configurations include:
- Default inventory configuration
- Default remote user

/etc/ansible/hosts is the default Ansible Inventory File

An inventory is a list of hosts that Ansible manages.

Inventory location may be specified as follows:
- Default /etc/ansible/hosts
- Specified by CLI `ansible -i`
- Can be set in ansible.cfg

Example Inventory File
---
mail.example.com ansible_port=5556

[webservers]
httpd1.example.com
httpd2.example.com

[labservers]
lab[01:99]

scoldham2 ansible_host=scoldham2c.mylabserver.com -> creates an alias and assigns the ansible_host variable for that alias
scoldham3 ansible_host=scoldham3c.mylabserver.com
---

While it is possible to connect to a remote host with Ansible via password authentication using -k (note lowercase),
it is not a common practice as it can cause significant overhead in terms of manual intervention.

Ansible is best implemented using a common user across all Ansible controlled systems.

The ssh-keygen and ssh-copy-id command can facilitate creating a pre-shared key for user authentication.

/etc/sudoers may be edited to allow your selected user to sudo any command without a password for
the most automated configuration using the line:
ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

It is also possible to prompt for a sudo password at runtime using -K (note uppercase) if desired.
Note that this can become a challenge when executing against many systems.

Add an ansible user to the control node
sudo useradd ansible -> creates ansible user without password (password not needed bc we wont be sshing in to control node)

ssh into one of the worker nodes
ssh scoldham2c.mylabserver.com
sudo useradd ansible -> creates user without password
sudo passwd ansible -> add password

back in control node
sudo su - ansible
ssh-keygen -> create ssh key pair
ssh-copy-id scoldham2c.mylabserver.com -> copy public key to worker node, use ansible password just created
ssh scoldham2c.mylabserver.com -> should log you in to that server without a password
ansible user on scoldham2c is not privileged, so need to log in as privileged user
ssh cloud_user@scoldham2c.mylabserver.com
sudo visudo -> opens sudoers file in vi
add this line
ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
sudo su - ansible -> should switch to ansible user without asking for a password
sudo su - -> should log in as root user from ansible user without asking for a password

Documentation
You can find more useful documentation at doc.ansible.com

A module index is provided at docs.ansible.com as well. It contains detailed information over each module.

Ansible ships with the ansible-doc command as well. The command:
- Specifies a module name as a parameter and provides module specific documentation.
- Combined with the -l flag lists installed modules with a brief description.
- ansible-doc -s [module_name] -> condensed version

Ad Hoc commands
Ansible ad-hoc commands and comparable bash commands

Playbooks are analagous to bash script (we'll look at those later)

Syntax: ansible <HOST> -b -m <MODULE> -a "<ARG1 ARG2 ARG3>"

HOST os a host of host group defined in the Ansible inventory file.

-b is for become, which replaces the deprecated -s flag as in sudo

Ansible escalates permission to --become-user (default root) using the method defined by --become-method (default sudo).

-m is for module and allows a command to be used on a module.

-a allows parameters to pass. If used without a module, it is like running a shell command on the target system(s).

ansible scoldham2 -m setup | less
errors out - bc set up as cloud_user, need to switch to ansible user to use rsa key
ansible scoldham3 -m ping

other examples
yum "name=<NAME> state=<STATE>"
ansible scoldham2 -m yum -a "name=httpd state=latest" -> fails bc not root
ansible scoldham2 -b -m yum -a "name=httpd state=latest" -> works bc switched to sudo

service "name=<NAME> state=<STATE>"
ansible scoldham2 -b -m service -a "name=httpd state=started"

copy "src=<SOURCE_PATH> /
dest=<ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_PATH>"

Ansible Playbooks are the primary means for Ansible to perform tasks

As ad-hoc commands are to bash commands, playbooks are to bash scripts.

Playbooks run using the ansible-playbook command, not the ansible command.

You must specify the playbook to run as a parameter.

Playbooks are written in YAML.

Playbooks contain different elements called plays.

Plays contain lists of hosts and, at minimum, one task.

Each task has a name and module.

Modules may have parameters.

Pro tip: Spaces matter!

Improper indentation can cause a playbook to err in a vague way.

Sample playbook:
---
- hosts: webservers
  become: yes

  tasks:
  - name: latest httpd installed
    yum:
      name: httpd
      state: latest
  - name: write apache config file
    template:
      src: /srv/httpd.j2
      dest: /etc/httpd.conf

- hosts: databases
  remote_user: root

  tasks:
  - name: latest postgresql installed
    yum:
      name: postgresql
      state: latest
  - name: postgresql must by started
    service:
      name: postgresql
      state: started

create an inventory file
vim inv
[webservers]
scoldham2c.mylabserver.com
scoldham3c.mylabserver.com
vim web.yml
--- # Bootstrap webservers
- hosts: webservers -> defined in the file above
  become: yes -> run everything as root
  tasks:
  - name: install httpd -> every task starts with a name, plain english to explain what happens
    yum: -> module name
      name: httpd
      state: latest -> parameters for yum
  - name: create index.html file
    file:
      name: /var/www/html/index.html
      state: touch -> equivalent to bash touch
  - name: add web content
    lineinfile:
      line: "here is some text"
      path: /var/www/html/index.html
  - name: start httpd
    service:
      name: httpd
      state: started

ansible-playbook -i inv web.yml -> -i allows you to specify an inventory file
running playbook will output results
curl scoldham2c.mylabserver.com:80/index.html returns "here is some text"

Check Mode provides a quick sanity check:
- Dry run; does not actually affect systems
- Syntax: ansible-playbook foo.yml --check

Retry file:
- If a playbook fails, a retry file is generated and contains the list of hosts where the playbook failed: playbook-name.retry
- The file may be specified using --limit with the same playbook to reattempt the playbook at a later time.

Plays should be idempotent, meaning they should be safe to run repeatedly against the same target without ill effect.

Ansible variables
Variable names should be letters, numbers, and underscores. They should always start with a letter

Examples of valid variable names:
- foobar
- foo_bar
- foo5

Variables can be scoped by group, host, or within a playbook.

Variables may be passed in via command line using the --extra-vars, the -e flag, or defined within a playbook.

Playbook example
Go into playbook above and change the lines
name: httpd
to
name: "{{ target_service }}"
after saving, run this in the terminal
ansible-playbook -i inv web.yml -e "target_service=httpd"

CLI Example:
ansible-playbook service.yml -e \
"target_hosts=localhost \
target_service=httpd";


Variables are referenced using double curly braces.

It is good practice to wrap variable names or statements containing variable names in weak quotes:
hosts: "{{ my_host_var }}"

Ansible Facts are simply various properties regarding a given remote system.

The setup module can retrieve facts.
ansible scoldham2 -m setup -> returns a lot on info

The filter parameter takes regex to allow you to prune fact output.
ansible scoldham2 -m setup -a filter=*ipv4* -> returns facts where the key has ipv4 in it

Facts are gathered by default in the Ansible Playbook execution
Edit web.yml
line: "here is some text" -> line: "{{ ansible_hostname }}" -> this variable will be defined by the gather_facts step of the playbook run

The keyword gather_facts may be set in the playbook to change fact gathering behavior
in playbook under become line add
gather_facts: no

It is possible to print Ansible facts in files using variables.

Facts may be filtered using the setup module ad-hoc by passing a value for the filter parameter.

The ansible command output may be directed to a file using the --tree outputfile flag which may be helpful when working with facts.

It is possible to use {{ ansible_facts }} for conditional plays based on facts.

The debug module may be used to help troubleshoot plays:
- Use to print detail information about in-progress plays
- Handy for troubleshooting

debug takes two primary parameters that are mutually exclusive:
- msg: A message that is printed to STDOUT
- var: A variable whose content is printed to STDOUT

Example:
- debug:
    msg: "System {{ inventory_hostname }}
has uuid {{ ansible_product_uuid }}"

The register module is used to store task output.

Several attributes are available: return code, stderr, and stdout.

The following play will store the results of the shell module in a variable named motd_contents:
- hosts: all
  tasks:
  - shell: cat /etc/motd
    register: motd_contents

In the web.yml playbook under tasks: line
- debug:
    var: target_service

to use register, add it at same level of indentation as module
- name: add web content
  lineinfile:
    line: "{{ ansible_hostname }}"
    path: /var/www/html/index.html
  register: task_debug
- debug:
    msg: "Output of lineinfile is: {{ task_debug }}"

Understanding Handlers in Ansible
Ansible provides a mechanism that allows an action to be flagged for execution when a task performs a change.

By only executing certain tasks during a change, plays are more efficient.

This mechanism is known as a handler in Ansible.

A handler may be called using the notify keyword:
- name: template configuration file
  template:
    src: foo.conf
    dest: /etc/foo.conf
  notify:
  - restart memcached

No matter how many times a handler is flagged in a play, it only runs during a play's final phase.

notify will only flag a handler if a task block makes changes.

A handler may be defined similarly to tasks:
handlers:
  - name: restart memcached
    service:
      name: memcached
      state: restarted
    listen: "restart cache services"

web.yml restructured to use handlers
--- # Bootstrap Webservers
- hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes
  tasks:
  - debug:
      var: target_service
  - name: install httpd
    yum:
      name: "{{ target_service }}"
      state: latest
    notify:   # if install httpd is changed, then notify the restart httpd handler
      - restart httpd
  - name: create index.html file
    file:
      name: /var/www/html/index.html
      state: touch
  - name: add web content
    lineinfile:
      line: "{{ ansible_hostname }}"
      path: /var/www/html/index.html
    notify:
      - restart httpd
    register: task_debug
  - debug:
      msg: "Output of lineinfile is: {{ task_debug }}"
  handlers:
  - name: Attempt to restart httpd
    service:
      name: httpd
      state: restarted
    listen: "restart httpd"

to test this out remove httpd from a server
ansible scoldham2 -b -m yum -a "name=httpd state=absent" -> -b become root -m module -a arguments
check that it worked by trying to curl
curl scoldham2c.mylabserver.com:80/index.html -> should get Connection refused error

To test the handler run
ansible-playbook -i inv web.yml -e "target_service=httpd"
should see that output includes RUNNING HANDLER [Attempt to restart httpd] for scoldham2 but not scoldham3
