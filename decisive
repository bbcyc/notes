Decisive
How to Make Better Choices in Life and Work
Chip Heath and Dan Heath

Chapter One
The Four Villains of Decision Making
1. Danny Kahneman: "A remarkable aspect of your mental life is that you are 
rarely stumped."
  - Should Shannon fire Clive? We form opinions effortlessly.

2. What's in our spotlight = the most accessible information + our 
interpretation of that information. But that will rarely be all that we need
to make a good decision.

3. Our decision "track record" isn't great. Trusting our guts or conducting
rigorous analysis won't fix it. But a good process will. 
  - Study: "Process mattered more than analysis--by a factor of six."

4. We can defeat the four villains of decision-making by learning to shift our
spotlights.

5. Villain 1: Narrow framing (unduly limiting the options we consider)
  - HopeLab had five firms work simultaneously on stage 1; "Can i do this 
    AND that?"

6. Villain 2: The confirmation bias (seeking out information that bolsters our
beliefs)
  - The tone-deaf American Idol contestant...
  - Lovallo: "Confirmation bias is probably the single biggest problem in 
    business."

7. Villain 3: Short-term emotion (being swayed by emotions that will fade)
  - Intel's Andy Grove got distance by asking, "What would our successors do?"

8. Villain 4: Overconfidence (having too much faith in our predictions)
  - "Four-piece groups with guitars, particularly, are finished."

9. The pros-and-cons process won't correct these problems. But the WRAP process
will.
  - Joseph Priestly conquered all four villains.

10. To make better decisions, use the WRAP process:
  Widen your Options.
  Reality-test your Assumptions.
  Attain Distance Before Deciding.
  Prepare to be Wrong.

Chapter Two
Avoid a Narrow Frame
1. Teenagers get trapped in a narrow frame. They are blind to their choices.
  - "Should I go to the party or not?"

2. Unfortunately, most organizations tend to make decisions like teenagers.
  - Quaker lost $1.5 billion in three years on the Snapple acquisition.
  - Nutt research: Only 29% of organizations considered more than one 
    alternative (versus 30% of teens).

3. Often our options are far more plentiful than we think.
  - College-selection counselor Price helps students explore their full range
    of options.

4. Why do we get stuck in a narrow frame? Focusing on our current options
means that other things are out of our spotlight.
  - Frederick got stuck choosing between two stereos--he failed to consider
    his other options.

5. How do we escape a narrow frame? Think about opportunity cost.
  - Keep the $14.99 for other purchases.
  - Eisenhower: One bomber= a modern brick school in more than 30 cities.

6. Or try the Vanishing Options Test: What if your current options disappeared?
  - Margaret Sanders realized she had a better option than firing Anna, her
    introverted receptionist.
  - When our options "disappear," we're forced to move our spotlights.

7. It's easier to spot a narrow frame from the outside--watch for it as a 
decision adviser. "Whether or not" decisions should set off warning bells.

Chapter Three 
Multitrack
1. Multitracking = considering more than one option simultaneously.
  - The name firm Lexicon widens its options by assigning a task to multiple
    small teams, including an "excursion team" that considers a related task
    from a very different domain.

2. When you consider multiple options simultaneously, you learn the "shape"
of the problem.
  - When designers created ads simultaneously, they scored higher on creativity
    and effectiveness.

3. Multitracking also keeps egos in check--and can actually be faster!
  - When you develop only one option, your ego is tied up in it.
  - Eisenhardt's research on Silicon Valley firms: Multitracking minimized 
    politics and provided a built-in fallback plan.

4. While decision paralysis may be a concern for people who consider many 
options, we're pushing for only one or two extra. And the payoff can be huge.
  - We're not considering 24 kinds of jam. When the German firm considered two 
    or more alternatives, it made six times as many "very good" decisions.

5. Beware "sham options."
  - Kissinger: "Nuclear war, present policy, or surrender."
  - One diagnostic: If people on your team disagree about the options, you
    have real options.

6. Toggle between the prevention and promotion mindsets.
  - Prevention focus = avoiding negative outcomes. Promotion focus = pursuing
    positive outcomes.
  - Companies who used both mindsets performed much better after a recession.
  - Doreen's husband, Frank, prompted her to think about boosting happiness,
    not just limiting stress.

7. Push for "this AND that" rather than "this OR that."

Chapter Four
Find Someone Who's Solved Your Problem
1. When you need more options but feel stuck, look for someone who's solved 
your problem.

2. Look outside: competitive analysis, benchmarking, best practices.
  - Sam Walton discovered an ingenious checkout solution by scoping out another
    store.

3. Look inside. Find your bright spots.
  - Kaiser's leaders found and scaled a solution for sepsis pioneered by one of
    Kaiser's own hospitals.
  - What can you learn from your own bright spots (e.g. the four days you went
    to the gym last month)?

4. Note: To be proactive, encode your greatest hits in a decision "playlist"
  - A checklist stops people from making an error; a playlist stimulates
    new ideas.
  - Advertisers Hughes and Johnson use a playlist to spark lots of creative
    ideas quickly.
  - A playlist for budget cuts might include a prompt to switch between the 
    prevention and promotion mindsets: Can you cut more here to invest more
    there?

5. A third place to look for ideas: in the distance. Ladder up via analogies.
  - Kevin Dunbar: Analogies are pillars of scientific problem solving. 
    Scientists make progress through analogies to similar experiments and 
    similar organisms.
  - Ladder up: Lower rungs show close analogies (low risk and low novelty),
    while higher rungs reveal more distant solutions (higher risk and higher
    novelty).
  - Fiona Fairhurst designed a speedier swimsuit by laddering up and analyzing
    "anything that move fast," including sharks and torpedoes.

6. Why generate your own ideas when you can sample the world's buffet of 
options?

Chapter Five 
Consider the Opposite
1. Confirmation bias = hunting for information that confirms our initial 
assumptions (which are often self-serving).
  - The hubris of CEOs can be counteracted by disagreement. We need the same
    disagreement to counteract confirmation bias.

2. We need to spark constructive disagreement within our organizations.
  - The devil's advocate, murder boards, and The Gong Show all license
    skepticism. How can we?
  - Roger Martin's brilliant question: "What would have to be true for this
    option to be the very best choice?"

3. To gather more trustworthy information, we can ask disconfirming questions.
  - Law students: "Who were the last three associates to leave the firm?
    What are they doing now? How can I contact them?"
  - iPod buyers: "What problems does the iPod have?"

4. Caution: Probing questions can backfire in situations with a power dynamic.
  - Doctors are wise to use open-ended questions. "What do you mean by 'dizzy'?"

5. Extreme disconfirmation: Can we force ourselves to consider the opposite of 
our instincts?
  - A marriage diary helps a frustrated spouse see that his/her partner isn't
    always selfish.
  - "Assuming positive intent" spurs us to interpret someone's actions/words
    in a more positive light.

6. We can even test our assumptions with a deliberate mistake.
  - Schoemaker's firm won $1 million in business by experimenting with the RFP
    process.
  - One woman actually married her "mistake."

7. Because we naturally seek self-confirming information, we need discipline to
consider the opposite.

Chapter Six
Zoom Out, Zoom In
1. Often we trust "the averages" over our instincts--but not as much as we 
should
  - We trust the horrible reviews of the Polynesian Resort. But we don't always
    seek reviews for our most important decisions (new job, college major).

2. The inside view = our evaluation of our specific situation. The outside
view = how things generally unfold in situations like ours. The outside view is
more accurate, but most people gravitate toward the inside view.
  - Jack knows his Thai restaurant will be a hit. Lumping himself with other
    restaurants feels wrong.
  - Kahneman's curriculum story: Even the dean, who knew the base rates, got 
    stuck in the inside view.

3. If you can't find the "base rates" for your decision, ask an expert.
  - You might ask an IP lawyer: "What percentage of cases get settled before
    trial?" etc.
  - Warning: Experts are good at estimating base rates but lousy at making
    predictions.

4. A "close-up" can add texture that's missing from the outside view.
  - Brian Zikmund-Fisher studied the base-rate outcomes of patients with MDS,
    but he also sought a close-up (discovering the need for exercise and a 
    "third adult").
  - FDR had his staff compile a statistical "mail brief," and he also read a 
    sample of the letters.
  - More close-ups: Xerox's customer officer of the day. "Going to the genba."
    Using competitor's paper towels.

5. To gather the best information, we should zoom out and zoom in. (Outside 
   view + close up.)

Chapter Seven
Ooch
1. Ooching = running small experiments to test our theories. Rather than 
jumping in headfirst, we dip a toe in. 
  - John Hanks at NI ooched with wireless sensors in the Costa Rican jungle.
  - Physical therapy students volunteer for at least a hundred hours before
    they enroll.
  - Legal secretary Peggy made a conscious decision to ooch away from her 
    obsessive editing habits.

2. Ooching is particularly useful because we're terrible at predicting the
future.
  - Tetlock's research showed that experts' predictions are worse than simple
    extrapolations from base rates.

3. Entrepreneurs ooch naturally. Rather than create business forecasts, they go
out and try things.
  - CarsDirect.com asked: Can we sell one car over the internet?
  - Researcher Sarasvathy on attitudes of successful entrepreneurs: "To the
    extent that we can control the future, we do not need to predict it."
  - Intuit's Scott Cook believes in "leadership by experiment," not by 
    "politics, persuasion, and PowerPoint." The successful India mobile-phone
    service would have failed a debate.

4. Caveat: Ooching is counterproductive for situations that require commitment.
  - The mid-twenties guy who wonders about marine biology should ooch. The guy
    who knows he needs a degree--but dreads going back--should not.

5. Common hiring error: We try to predict success via interviews. We should
ooch instead.
  - Dan Heath wrongly agonized about whether to hire an obviously qualified
    artist.
  - Studies show that interviews are less diagnostic than work samples, peer
    ratings, etc. Can you nix the interview and offer a short-term consulting
    contract?

6. Why would we ever predict when we can know?

Chapter Eight
Overcome Short-Term Emotion
1. Fleeting emotions tempt us to make decisions that are bad in the long term.
  - Car salesmen are trained to prey on customers' emotions to close a deal 
    quickly.

2. To overcome distracting short-term emotions, we need to attain some distance.
  - Millionaire teacher Andre Hallam avoided car lots so he could stick to his
    criteria.

3. 10/10/10 provides distance by forcing us to consider future emotions as much
   as present ones.
  - 10 minutes/10 months/10 years
  - A 10/10/10 analysis tipped Annie toward saying "I love you" first to Karl.

4. Our decisions are often altered by two subtle short-term emotions: (1) mere
exposure: we like what's familiar to us; and (2) loss aversion: losses are more
painful than gains are pleasant.
  - How many of our organizational truths are ideas that we like merely because
    they've been repeated a lot?
  - Students given a mug won't sell it for less than $7.12, even though five 
    minutes earlier they wouldn't have paid more than $2.87!

5. Loss aversion + mere exposure = status-quo bias.
  - Paypal: Ditching the PalmPilot product was a no-brainer--but it didn't feel
    that way.

6. We can attain distance by looking at our situation from an outsider's 
perspective.
  - Andy Grove asked, "What would our successors do?"
  - Adding distance highlights what is most important; it allows us to see the
    forest, not the trees.

7. Perhaps the most powerful question for resolving personal decisions is 
"What would I tell my best friend to do in this situation?"

Chapter Nine
Honor Your Core Priorities
1. Quieting short-term emotion won't always make a decision easy.
  - Even when Kim Ramirez's initial excitement faded, she still agonized for
    weeks.

2. Agonizing decisions are often a sign of conflict among your core priorities.
  - Core priorities: long-term emotional values, goals, aspirations. What kind
    of person do you want to be? What kind of organizations do you want to 
    build?
  - The goal is not to eliminate emotion. It's to honor the emotions that count.

3. By identifying and enshrining your core priorities, you make it easier to 
resolve present and future dilemmas.
  - At Interplast, recurring, nagging debates were settled when executives
    determined that the patien was the ultimate "customer."
  - "Wayne's Rules" allowed Dell's field consultants to make decisions correctly
 and consistently.

4. Establishing your core priorities is, unfortunately, not the same as binding
yourself to them.
  - MIT Study: Managers had done no work on their core priorities in the 
    previous week!

5. To carve out space to pursue our core priorities, we must go on the offense
against lesser priorities.
  - On the USS Benfold, the crew actively fought the List B items like 
    repainting (e.g., by using stainless-steel bolts that wouldn't leave rust
    stains).
  - Jim Collin's "stop-doing list": What will you give up so that you have more
    time to spend on your priorities?
  - Bregman's hourly beep: Am I doing what I most need to be doing right now?

Chapter Ten 
Bookend the Future
1. The future is not a "point"--a single scenario that we must predict. It is
a range. We should bookend the future, considering a range of outcomes from
very bad to very good.
  - Investor Penstock bet on Coinstar when his bookend analysis showed much
    more upside than downside.
  - Our predictions grow more accurate when we stretch our bookends outward.

2. To prepare for the lower bookend, we need a premortem. "It's a yer from now.
Our decision has failed utterly. Why?"
  - The 100,000 Homes Campaign avoided a legal threat by using a premortem-style
    analysis.

3. To be ready for the upper bookend, we need a preparade. "It's a year from
now. We're heroes. Will we be ready for success?"
  - The producer of Softsoap, hoping for a huge national launch, locked down 
    the supply of plastic pumps for 18 to 24 months.

4. To prepare for what can't be foreseen, we can use a "safety factor."
  - Elevator cables are made 11 times stronger than needed; software schedules
    include a "buffer factor."

5. Anticipating problems helps us cope with them.
  - The "realistic job interview": Revealing a job's warts up front "vaccinates"
 people against dissatisfaction.
  - Sandra rehearsed how she would ask her boss for a raise and what she'd say
    and do at various problem moments.

6. By bookending--anticipating and preparing for both adversity and success--we
stack the deck in favor of our decisions.

Chapter Eleven
Set a Tripwire
1. In life, we naturally slip into autopilot, leaving past decisions 
unquestioned.
  - E.g., we've all been peeling bananas from the top. Nothing ever compelled
    us to reconsider it.

2. A tripwire can snap us awake and make us realize we have a choice.
  - Zappo's $1,000 offer created a conscious fork in the road for new hires.
  - David Lee Roth's brown M&Ms signaled that he needed to inspect the 
    production.

3. Tripwires can be especially useful when change is gradual.
  - Digital images killed Kodak; its executives could have used tripwires to 
    spark a bolder response.

4. For people stuck on autopilot, consider deadlines or partitions.
  - "Six months ago, you though you'd have a recording contract by now."
  - Partitions: Day laborers saved more when their pay was put in 10 envelopes
    versus 1.

5. We tend to escalate our investment in poor decisions; partitions can help
rein that in. 
  - E.g., "We won't allocate more than $30,000 to jump-start this failing
    project."

6. Tripwires can actually create a safe space for risk taking. They (1) cap 
risk; and (2) quiet your mind until the trigger is hit.

7. Many powerful tripwires are triggered by patterns rather than dates/metrics/
budgets.
  - Unexpected problems: A children's hospital told nurses to call the rapid-
    response team if they were worried about a patient.
  - Peter Drucker: Be ready for "unexpected success."
  - Rogaine scientists were savvy enough to spot the opportunity in back-hair
    growth.

8. Tripwires can provide a precious realization: We have a choice to make.

Chapter Twelve 
Trusting the Process
1. Decisions made by groups have an additional burden: They must be seen as
fair.

2. "Bargaining"--horse-trading until all sides can live with the choice--makes
for good decisions that will be seen as fair.
  - Nutt: Bargaining always improves decision success; the effect was
    "dramatic."
  - Bargaining will take more time up front--but it accelerates implementation.

3. Procedural justice is critical in determining how people feel about a 
decision.
  - Court cases: Losers who perceive procedural justice are almost as happy as
    winner who don't.

4. We should make sure people are able to perceive that the process is just.
  - High-stakes mediator Mnookin: "I state back the other side's position
    better than they could state it."
  - Entrepreneur Hitz: "Sometimes the best way to defend a decision is to point
    out it's flaws."

5. A trustworthy process can help use navigate even the thorniest decisions.
  - Matt D'Amigo, the founder of ARTS, found a way to combine the need to 
    serve local kids with his aspirations to make a national impact.

6. "Process" isn't glamorous. But the confidence it can provide is precious.
Trusting a process can permit us to take bigger risks, to make bolder choices.
Studies of the elderly show that people regret not what they did but what they
didn't do.
