Docker Deep Dive
Introduction to Docker
What is Docker?
Docker:

Docker, Inc. the company
Docker, the container runtime and orchestration engine
Docker, the open-source project (Moby)
The Company
Docker, Inc.:

Based in San Francisco
Founded by Solomon Hykes
Start as a PaaS provider called dotCloud
dotCloud leveraged Linux containers
Their internal tool used to manage containers was nick-named Docker
In 2013 dotCloud was rebranded as Docker
The Runtime and Orchestration Engine
The Docker runtime and orchestration engine:

Most people are referring to the Docker Engine
Two main editions:
Enterprise Edition (EE)
Community Edition (CE)
Both are released quarterly:
CE is supported for 4 months
EE is supported for 12 months
The Open-Source Project
Moby:

The upstream project of Docker
Breaks Docker down into more modular components
Code is available on GitHub:
https://github.com/moby/moby
Why Use Docker?
Docker Use Cases:

Dev/Prod parity:
Dev and Production environment are the same
Bugs in Production can be replicated in Development
Simplifying Configuration:
Lets you put your environment and configuration into code and deploy it
Allows the same Docker configuration to be used in a variety of environments
Decouples infrastructure requirements from the application environment
Code Pipeline Management:
Build standards and repeatable processes
Developer Productivity
App Isolation
Server Consolidation
Debugging Capabilities
Multi-tenancy

Docker Architecture
Client-server architecture
The client talks to the Docker daemon
The Docker daemon handles:
- Building
- Running
- Distributing
Both communicate using a REST API
- UNIX sockets
- Network interface
The Docker daemon (dockerd);
Listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects
  Images
  Containers
  Networks
  Volumes
The Docker client (docker)
  is how users interact with Docker
  The client sends these commands to dockerd
Docker registries
  Stores docker images
  Public registry such as DockerHub
  Run your own private registry
Docker objects
  Images
    Read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container
    Images is based on another image
    Create your own images
    Use a Dockerfile to build images
  Containers
    Runnable instance of an image
    Connect a container to networks
    Attach storage
    Create a new image based on its current state
    Isolated from other containers and the host machine
  Services
    Scale containers acros multiple Docker daemons
    Docker Swarm
    Define the desired state
    Service is load-balanced
  Docker Swarm
    Multiple docker daemons (master and workers)
    The daemons all communicate using the Docker API
    Supported in Docker 1.12 and higher

Docker engine:

Modular in design:
  Batteries included but replaceable
Based on open-standards outline by the Open Container Initiative
The major components:
Docker client
Docker daemon
containerd
runc
The components work together to create and run containers
A Brief History of the Docker Engine
The first release of Docker:

The Docker daemon:
Monolithic binary
Docker client
Docker API
Container runtime
Image builds
Much more...
LXC:
Namespaces
Control groups (cgroups)
Linux-specific
Refactoring of the Docker Engine
LXC was later replaced with libcontainer:

Docker 0.9
Platform agnostic

Issues with the monolithic Docker daemon:
  Harder to innovate
  Slow
  Not what the ecosystem wanted

Docker became more modular:
Smaller more specialized tools
Pluggable architecture

Open Container Initiative:
  Image spec
  Container runtime spec
  Version 1.0 release in 2017
  Docker Inc. heavily contributed
  Docker 1.11 (2016) used the specification as much as possible

runc:
  Implemenation of the OCI container-runtime-spec
  Lightweght CLI wrapper for libcontainer
  Create containers

containerd:
  Manages container lifecycle
    Start
    Stop
    Pause
    Delete
  Image management
  Part of the 1.11 release

shim:
Implemenation of daemonless Containers
containerd forks an instance of runc for each new container
runc process exits after the container is created
shim process becomes the container parent
Responsible for:
STDIN and STDOUT
Reporting exit status to the Docker daemon
Running Containers
docker container run -it --name <NAME> <IMAGE>:<TAG>

Creating a container:
CLI use for executing a command
Docker client uses the appropriate API payload
POSTs to the correct API endpoint
Docker deamon receives instructions
Docker deamon calls containerd to start a new container
Docker daemon uses gRPC (a CRUD style API)
containerd creates an OCI bundle from the Docker image
Tells runc to create a container using the OCI bundle
runc interfaces with the OS kernal to get the constructs needed to create a container
This includes namespaces, cgroups, etc.
Container process starts as a child process
runc exits once the container starts
Process is complete, and container is running

Docker Images and Containers
  What are Docker images?

Docker Images:
  Files comprised of multiple layers
  Execute code in a Docker container
  Built from the instructions
  Use images to create an instance of a container

Docker images and layers
  Image are made of multiple layers.
  Each layer represents an instruction in the image’s Dockerfile.
  Each layer except, the very last one, is read-only.
  Each layer is only a set of differences from the layer before it.
  Layers are stacked on top of each other.

  Containers add new writable layers on top of the underlying layers
  All changes made to a running container is made to the Container layer

What are containers?
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its
  dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

Container and layers
  Top writable layer
  All changes are stored in the writable layer
  The writable layer is deleted when the container is deleted
  The image remains unchanged

Docker Hub
In this lesson, we will take a quick look at Docker Hub and its available features.

What is Docker Hub?
Docker Hub:

Public Docker registry
Provided by Docker
Features:
Repositories
Teams and Organizations
Official Images
Publisher Images
Builds
Webhooks
https://hub.docker.com/signup

docker container ps
docker container inspect <containerID>
curl http://<ip from above command>
docker container top
docker container ls
docker container attach <containerID> - stdout, stdin to term
docker container logs <containerID>
docker container stats <containerID>

Creating Containers
In this lesson, we will take a deeper look into creating containers, by exploring a few of the flags that will alter it's behavior when created.

docker container run:

--help Print usage
--rm Automatically remove the container when it exits
-d, --detach Run container in background and print container ID
-i, --interactive Keep STDIN open even if not attached
--name string Assign a name to the container
-p, --publish list Publish a container's port(s) to the host
-t, --tty Allocate a pseudo-TTY
-v, --volume list Mount a volume (the bind type of mount)
--mount mount Attach a filesystem mount to the container
--network string Connect a container to a network (default "default")
Create a container and attach to it:

docker container run –it busybox
Create a container and run it in the background:

docker container run –d nginx
Create a container that you name and run it in the background:

docker container run –d –name myContainer busybox

docker container run --help
docker container run busybox
docker container ls -a
docker container run --rm busybox - deletes container when done
docker container run nginx
docker container run -it busybox
docker container run --name my_busybox busybox

Exposing and Publishing Container Ports
Building on what we've already learned, this lesson will focus on exposing ports on a container, as well as how to publish them.

Exposing:

Expose a port or a range of ports
This does not publish the port
Use --expose [PORT]
docker container run --expose 1234 [IMAGE]
Publishing:

Maps a container's port to a host`s port
-p or --publish publishes a container's port(s) to the host
-P, or --publish-all publishes all exposed ports to random ports
docker container run -p [HOST_PORT]:[CONTAINER_PORT] [IMAGE]
docker container run -p [HOST_PORT]:[CONTAINER_PORT]/tcp -p [HOST_PORT]:[CONTAINER_PORT]/udp [IMAGE]
docker container run -P
Lists all port mappings or a specific mapping for a container:

docker container port [Container_NAME]

docker run -d nginx
docker container ls
curl localhost - fails bc no port mapping set up for port 80
docker container inspect <containerID>
curl <ipAddress from above> - returns nginx welcome page
ports need to be mapped
docker container run -d --expose 3000 nginx
docker container ls - shows port 3000
docker container run -d --expose 3000 -p 80:3000 nginx -> 80-port this will be running on host machine 3000-container port that port 80 maps to
docker container ls
curl localhost:3000 - doesn't work because no process is listening on 3000
docker container run -d --expose 3000 -p 8080:80 nginx
curl localhost:8080 - get nginx welcome page
docker container run -d -p 8081:80/tcp -p 8081:80/udp nginx - can use -p multiple times for multiple ports
docker container run -d -P nginx - randomly assign port from host to container
docker container port <containerID> - see all port mappings for a container

Executing Container Commands
In this lesson we'll see three different ways to execute commands on containers.

Executing a command:

Dockerfile
During a Docker run
Using the exec command
Commands can be:

One and done Commands
Long running Commands
Start a container with a command:

docker container run [IMAGE] [CMD]
Execute a command on a container:

docker container exec -it [NAME] [CMD]
Example:

docker container run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
docker container ps
docker container exec -it [NAME] /bin/bash
docker container exec -it [NAME] ls /usr/share/nginx/html/

Nginx dockerfile https://github.com/nginxinc/docker-nginx/blob/baa050df601b5e798431a9db458e16f53b1031f6/mainline/stretch/Dockerfile

docker container run -d nginx
docker container run -it nginx /bin/bash
nginx -g 'daemon off;'
in another terminal, log in to server
docker container ls - find one that is running /bin/bash
docker container inspect <containerID>
curl <ipAddress from above>
docker container exec -it <containerID> ls /usr/share/nginx/html

Container Logging
In this lesson, you will learn how to view the logs of a container to get vital output of your application. You will also learn about some of the logging best practices of containerized applications.

Create a container using the weather-app image.

docker container run --name weather-app -d -p 80:3000 linuxacademycontent/weather-app
Show information logged by a running container:

docker container logs [NAME]
Show information logged by all containers participating in a service:

docker service logs [SERVICE]
Logs need to be output to STDOUT and STDERR.

Nginx Example:

RUN ln -sf /dev/stdout /var/log/nginx/access.log \
    && ln -sf /dev/stderr /var/log/nginx/error.log
Debug a failed container deploy:

docker container run -d --name ghost_blog \
-e database__client=mysql \
-e database__connection__host=mysql \
-e database__connection__user=root \
-e database__connection__password=P4sSw0rd0! \
-e database__connection__database=ghost \
-p 8080:2368 \
ghost:1-alpine

Networking Overview
In this lesson, we will go over the components and theory of how networking functions in Docker.

Docker Networking 101
Docker Networking:

Open-source pluggable architecture
Container Network Model (CNM)
libnetwork implements CNM
Drivers extend the network topologies
Network Drivers:

bridge
host
overlay
macvlan - assign a mac address
none - disable networking
Network plugins

Container Network Model
Defines three building blocks:

Sandboxes - isolates network stack
Endpoints - virtual network interfaces
Networks - software implementation of 802.1 bridge

Networking Commands
Networking Basics
ifconfig
List all Docker network commands:

docker network -h
connect Connect a container to a network create Create a network disconnect Disconnect a container from a network inspect Display detailed information on one or more networks ls List networks prune Remove all unused networks rm Remove one or more networks

List all Docker networks on the host:

docker network ls
docker network ls --no-trunc
Getting detailed info on a network:

docker network inspect [NAME]
Creating a network:

docker network create br00
Deleting a network:

docker network rm [NAME]
Remove all unused networks:

docker network prune
Adding and Removing containers to a network
Create a container with no network:

docker container run -d --name network-test03 -p 8081:80 nginx
Create a new network:

docker network create br01
Add the container to the bridge network:

docker network connect br01 network-test03
Inspect network-test03 to see the networks:

docker container inspect network-test03
Remove network-test03 from br01:

docker network disconnect br01 network-test03

ifconfig - show all adaptors
docker network -h
docker network ls
dont delete any default networks
docker network inpect bridge
docker network create br00
docker network inspect br00
docker network rm br00
docker network prune - removes all unused networks
docker container run -d --name network-test03 -p 8081:80 nginx
docker network create br01
docker network connect br01 network-test03
docker container inspect network-test03
docker network disconnect br01 network-test03

Networking Containers
In this lesson, we will dig deeper into container networking by supplying our own subnet and gateway when creating a new network. We will then move on to networking two different containers using an internal network. This will allow one container to be publicly accessible while the other one is not.

Creating a network and defining a Subnet and Gateway
Create a bridge network with a subnet and gateway:

docker network create --subnet 10.1.0.0/24 --gateway 10.1.0.1 br02
Run ifconfig to view the bridge interface for br02:

ifconfig
Inspect the br02 network:

docker network inspect br02
Prune all unused networks:

docker network prune
Create a network with an IP range:

docker network create --subnet 10.1.0.0/16 --gateway 10.1.0.1 \
--ip-range=10.1.4.0/24 --driver=bridge --label=host4network br04
Inspect the br04 network:

docker network inspect br04
Create a container using the br04 network:

docker container run --name network-test01 -it --network br04 centos /bin/bash
Install Net Tools:

yum update -y
yum install -y net-tools
Get the IP info for the container:

ifconfig
Get the gateway info the container:

netstat -rn
Get the DNS info for the container:

cat /etc/resolv.conf
Assigning IPs to a container:
Create a new container and assign an IP to it:

docker container run -d --name network-test02 --ip 10.1.4.102 --network br04 nginx
Get the IP info for the container:

docker container inspect network-test02 | grep IPAddr
Inspect network-test03 to see that br01 was removed:

docker container inspect network-test04
Networking two containers
Create an internal network:

docker network create -d bridge --internal localhost
Create a MySQL container that is connected to localhost:

docker container run -d --name test_mysql \
-e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=P4sSw0rd0 \
--network localhost mysql:5.7
Create a container that can ping the MySQL container:

docker container run -it --name ping-mysql \
--network bridge --network localhost \
centos
Create a container that can't ping the MySQL container:

docker container run -it --name cant-ping-mysql \
centos
Create a Nginx container that is not publicly accessible:

docker container run -d --name private-nginx -p 8081:80 --network localhost nginx
Inspect private-nginx:

docker container inspect private-nginx

docker network create --subnet 10.1.0.0/24 --gateway 10.1.0.1 br02
docker netowrk ls
ifconfig
docker network inspect
docker container rm <containerID>
docker network prune
docker network ls
docker network create --subnet 10.1.0.0/16 --gateway 10.1.0.1 \
--ip-range=10.1.4.0/24 --driver=bridge --label=host4network br04
docker network ls
docker network inspect br04
docker container run --name network-test01 -it --network br04 centos /bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y net-tools
ifconfig
netstat -rn
cat /etc/resolv.conf
ping google.com
exit
docker container run -d --name network-test02 --ip 10.1.4.102 --network br04 nginx
docker container inspect network-test02 | grep IPAddr
docker network create -d bridge --internal localhost
docker container run -d --name test_mysql \
-e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=P4sSw0rd0 \
--network localhost mysql:5.7
docker container run -it ping-mysql \
--network bridge --network localhost \
centos
ping test_mysql
docker container run -it --name cant-ping-mysql centos
ping test_mysql -> doesnt work since they are not on the same network
exit
docker container run -d --name private-nginx -p 8081:80 --network localhost nginx
curl localhost:8081 - doesnt return because network is internal, not bound to anything on docker host
docker inspect private-nginx
curl ip of container and get result back

Hands-On Lab - Docker Networking
Create a bridge network called frontend that will be publicly accessible.
Create a second bridge network called localhost that will be internal.
Deploy a MySQL container called database that will use the localhost network. Use the mysql 5.7 image:

Use the -e flag to set MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD to P4sSw0rd0.
The MySQL container should run in the background.
Next, deploy a second container call frontend-app and publish port 80 on the host to port 80 on the container.
The container will be attached to both of the frontend networks. Use the latest Nginx image.
The Nginx container should run in the background.

Once the Nginx container is created, connect it to the localhost network.

Create the frontend network
Use the docker network to create the frontend network:
docker network create frontend

Create the localhost network
User the docker network command to create the localhost network:
docker network create localhost --internal

Create a MySQL container
Create a MySQL container that is attached to the localhost network:
docker container run -d --name database --network localhost -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=P4ssW0rd0! mysql:5.7

Create an Nginx container
Create an Nginx container that is attached to the localhost network:
docker container run -d --name frontend-app --network frontend nginx:latest

Connect frontend-app container to the localhost network:
docker network connect localhost frontend-app

Connect frontend-app to the internal network
Connect 'frontend-app' to the 'localhost' network.
docker network connect localhost frontend-app
