Dev and Production environment are the same
Bugs in Production can be replicated in Development
Simplifying Configuration:
Lets you put your environment and configuration into code and deploy it
Allows the same Docker configuration to be used in a variety of environments
Decouples infrastructure requirements from the application environment
Code Pipeline Management:
Build standards and repeatable processes
Developer Productivity
App Isolation
Server Consolidation
Debugging Capabilities
Multi-tenancy
