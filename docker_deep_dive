Docker Deep Dive
Introduction to Docker
What is Docker?
Docker:

Docker, Inc. the company
Docker, the container runtime and orchestration engine
Docker, the open-source project (Moby)
The Company
Docker, Inc.:

Based in San Francisco
Founded by Solomon Hykes
Start as a PaaS provider called dotCloud
dotCloud leveraged Linux containers
Their internal tool used to manage containers was nick-named Docker
In 2013 dotCloud was rebranded as Docker
The Runtime and Orchestration Engine
The Docker runtime and orchestration engine:

Most people are referring to the Docker Engine
Two main editions:
Enterprise Edition (EE)
Community Edition (CE)
Both are released quarterly:
CE is supported for 4 months
EE is supported for 12 months
The Open-Source Project
Moby:

The upstream project of Docker
Breaks Docker down into more modular components
Code is available on GitHub:
https://github.com/moby/moby
Why Use Docker?
Docker Use Cases:

Dev/Prod parity:
Dev and Production environment are the same
Bugs in Production can be replicated in Development
Simplifying Configuration:
Lets you put your environment and configuration into code and deploy it
Allows the same Docker configuration to be used in a variety of environments
Decouples infrastructure requirements from the application environment
Code Pipeline Management:
Build standards and repeatable processes
Developer Productivity
App Isolation
Server Consolidation
Debugging Capabilities
Multi-tenancy

Docker Architecture
Client-server architecture
The client talks to the Docker daemon
The Docker daemon handles:
- Building
- Running
- Distributing
Both communicate using a REST API
- UNIX sockets
- Network interface
The Docker daemon (dockerd);
Listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects
  Images
  Containers
  Networks
  Volumes
The Docker client (docker)
  is how users interact with Docker
  The client sends these commands to dockerd
Docker registries
  Stores docker images
  Public registry such as DockerHub
  Run your own private registry
Docker objects
  Images
    Read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container
    Images is based on another image
    Create your own images
    Use a Dockerfile to build images
  Containers
    Runnable instance of an image
    Connect a container to networks
    Attach storage
    Create a new image based on its current state
    Isolated from other containers and the host machine
  Services
    Scale containers across multiple Docker daemons
    Docker Swarm
    Define the desired state
    Service is load-balanced
  Docker Swarm
    Multiple docker daemons (master and workers)
    The daemons all communicate using the Docker API
    Supported in Docker 1.12 and higher

Docker engine:

Modular in design:
  Batteries included but replaceable
Based on open-standards outline by the Open Container Initiative
The major components:
Docker client
Docker daemon
containerd
runc
The components work together to create and run containers
A Brief History of the Docker Engine
The first release of Docker:

The Docker daemon:
Monolithic binary
Docker client
Docker API
Container runtime
Image builds
Much more...
LXC:
Namespaces
Control groups (cgroups)
Linux-specific
Refactoring of the Docker Engine
LXC was later replaced with libcontainer:

Docker 0.9
Platform agnostic

Issues with the monolithic Docker daemon:
  Harder to innovate
  Slow
  Not what the ecosystem wanted

Docker became more modular:
Smaller more specialized tools
Pluggable architecture

Open Container Initiative:
  Image spec
  Container runtime spec
  Version 1.0 release in 2017
  Docker Inc. heavily contributed
  Docker 1.11 (2016) used the specification as much as possible

runc:
  Implemenation of the OCI container-runtime-spec
  Lightweght CLI wrapper for libcontainer
  Create containers

containerd:
  Manages container lifecycle
    Start
    Stop
    Pause
    Delete
  Image management
  Part of the 1.11 release

shim:
Implemenation of daemonless Containers
containerd forks an instance of runc for each new container
runc process exits after the container is created
shim process becomes the container parent
Responsible for:
STDIN and STDOUT
Reporting exit status to the Docker daemon
Running Containers
docker container run -it --name <NAME> <IMAGE>:<TAG>

Creating a container:
CLI use for executing a command
Docker client uses the appropriate API payload
POSTs to the correct API endpoint
Docker deamon receives instructions
Docker deamon calls containerd to start a new container
Docker daemon uses gRPC (a CRUD style API)
containerd creates an OCI bundle from the Docker image
Tells runc to create a container using the OCI bundle
runc interfaces with the OS kernal to get the constructs needed to create a container
This includes namespaces, cgroups, etc.
Container process starts as a child process
runc exits once the container starts
Process is complete, and container is running

Docker Images and Containers
  What are Docker images?

Docker Images:
  Files comprised of multiple layers
  Execute code in a Docker container
  Built from the instructions
  Use images to create an instance of a container

Docker images and layers
  Image are made of multiple layers.
  Each layer represents an instruction in the image’s Dockerfile.
  Each layer except, the very last one, is read-only.
  Each layer is only a set of differences from the layer before it.
  Layers are stacked on top of each other.

  Containers add new writable layers on top of the underlying layers
  All changes made to a running container is made to the Container layer

What are containers?
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its
  dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

Container and layers
  Top writable layer
  All changes are stored in the writable layer
  The writable layer is deleted when the container is deleted
  The image remains unchanged

Docker Hub
In this lesson, we will take a quick look at Docker Hub and its available features.

What is Docker Hub?
Docker Hub:

Public Docker registry
Provided by Docker
Features:
Repositories
Teams and Organizations
Official Images
Publisher Images
Builds
Webhooks
https://hub.docker.com/signup

Creating Containers
In this lesson, we will take a deeper look into creating containers, by exploring a few of the flags that will alter it's behavior when created.

docker container run:

--help Print usage
--rm Automatically remove the container when it exits
-d, --detach Run container in background and print container ID
-i, --interactive Keep STDIN open even if not attached
--name string Assign a name to the container
-p, --publish list Publish a container's port(s) to the host
-t, --tty Allocate a pseudo-TTY
-v, --volume list Mount a volume (the bind type of mount)
--mount mount Attach a filesystem mount to the container
--network string Connect a container to a network (default "default")

Create a container and attach to it:
docker container run –it busybox

Create a container and run it in the background:
docker container run –d nginx

Create a container that you name and run it in the background:
docker container run –d –name myContainer busybox

docker container run --help
docker container run busybox
docker container ls -a
docker container run --rm busybox - deletes container when done
docker container run nginx
docker container run -it busybox
docker container run --name my_busybox busybox

Exposing and Publishing Container Ports
Building on what we've already learned, this lesson will focus on exposing ports on a container, as well as how to publish them.

Exposing:
Expose a port or a range of ports
This does not publish the port
Use --expose [PORT]
docker container run --expose 1234 [IMAGE]

Publishing:
Maps a container's port to a host`s port
-p or --publish publishes a container's port(s) to the host
-P, or --publish-all publishes all exposed ports to random ports
docker container run -p [HOST_PORT]:[CONTAINER_PORT] [IMAGE]
docker container run -p [HOST_PORT]:[CONTAINER_PORT]/tcp -p [HOST_PORT]:[CONTAINER_PORT]/udp [IMAGE]
docker container run -P

Lists all port mappings or a specific mapping for a container:
docker container port [Container_NAME]

docker run -d nginx
docker container ls
curl localhost - fails bc no port mapping set up for port 80
docker container inspect <containerID>
curl <ipAddress from above> - returns nginx welcome page
ports need to be mapped
docker container run -d --expose 3000 nginx
docker container ls - shows port 3000
docker container run -d --expose 3000 -p 80:3000 nginx -> 80-port this will be running on host machine 3000-container port that port 80 maps to
docker container ls
curl localhost:3000 - doesn't work because no process is listening on 3000
docker container run -d --expose 3000 -p 8080:80 nginx
curl localhost:8080 - get nginx welcome page
docker container run -d -p 8081:80/tcp -p 8081:80/udp nginx - can use -p multiple times for multiple ports
docker container run -d -P nginx - randomly assign port from host to container
docker container port <containerID> - see all port mappings for a container

Executing Container Commands
In this lesson we'll see three different ways to execute commands on containers.

Executing a command:
Dockerfile
During a Docker run
Using the exec command

Commands can be:
One and done Commands
Long running Commands

Start a container with a command:
docker container run [IMAGE] [CMD]

Execute a command on a container:
docker container exec -it [NAME] [CMD]

Example:
docker container run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
docker container ps
docker container exec -it [NAME] /bin/bash
docker container exec -it [NAME] ls /usr/share/nginx/html/

Nginx dockerfile https://github.com/nginxinc/docker-nginx/blob/baa050df601b5e798431a9db458e16f53b1031f6/mainline/stretch/Dockerfile

docker container run -d nginx
docker container run -it nginx /bin/bash
nginx -g 'daemon off;'
in another terminal, log in to server
docker container ls - find one that is running /bin/bash
docker container inspect <containerID>
curl <ipAddress from above>
docker container exec -it <containerID> ls /usr/share/nginx/html

Container Logging
In this lesson, you will learn how to view the logs of a container to get vital output of your application.
You will also learn about some of the logging best practices of containerized applications.

Create a container using the weather-app image.

docker container run --name weather-app -d -p 80:3000 linuxacademycontent/weather-app

Show information logged by a running container:
docker container logs [NAME]

Show information logged by all containers participating in a service:
docker service logs [SERVICE]
Logs need to be output to STDOUT and STDERR.

Nginx Example:
RUN ln -sf /dev/stdout /var/log/nginx/access.log \
    && ln -sf /dev/stderr /var/log/nginx/error.log

Debug a failed container deploy:
docker container run -d --name ghost_blog \
-e database__client=mysql \
-e database__connection__host=mysql \
-e database__connection__user=root \
-e database__connection__password=P4sSw0rd0! \
-e database__connection__database=ghost \
-p 8080:2368 \
ghost:1-alpine

Networking Overview
In this lesson, we will go over the components and theory of how networking functions in Docker.

Docker Networking 101
Docker Networking:

Open-source pluggable architecture
Container Network Model (CNM)
libnetwork implements CNM
Drivers extend the network topologies
Network Drivers:

bridge
host
overlay
macvlan - assign a mac address
none - disable networking
Network plugins

Container Network Model
Defines three building blocks:

Sandboxes - isolates network stack
Endpoints - virtual network interfaces
Networks - software implementation of 802.1 bridge

Networking Commands
Networking Basics
ifconfig
List all Docker network commands:

docker network -h
connect Connect a container to a network
create Create a network
disconnect Disconnect a container from a network
inspect Display detailed information on one or more networks
ls List networks
prune Remove all unused networks
rm Remove one or more networks

List all Docker networks on the host:
docker network ls
docker network ls --no-trunc

Getting detailed info on a network:
docker network inspect [NAME]

Creating a network:
docker network create br00

Deleting a network:
docker network rm [NAME]

Remove all unused networks:
docker network prune

Adding and Removing containers to a network
Create a container with no network:
docker container run -d --name network-test03 -p 8081:80 nginx

Create a new network:
docker network create br01

Add the container to the bridge network:
docker network connect br01 network-test03

Inspect network-test03 to see the networks:
docker container inspect network-test03

Remove network-test03 from br01:
docker network disconnect br01 network-test03

ifconfig - show all adaptors
docker network -h
docker network ls
dont delete any default networks
docker network inpect bridge
docker network create br00
docker network inspect br00
docker network rm br00
docker network prune - removes all unused networks
docker container run -d --name network-test03 -p 8081:80 nginx
docker network create br01
docker network connect br01 network-test03
docker container inspect network-test03
docker network disconnect br01 network-test03

Networking Containers
In this lesson, we will dig deeper into container networking by supplying our own subnet and gateway when creating a new network.
We will then move on to networking two different containers using an internal network.
This will allow one container to be publicly accessible while the other one is not.

Creating a network and defining a Subnet and Gateway
Create a bridge network with a subnet and gateway:
docker network create --subnet 10.1.0.0/24 --gateway 10.1.0.1 br02

Run ifconfig to view the bridge interface for br02:
ifconfig

Inspect the br02 network:
docker network inspect br02

Prune all unused networks:
docker network prune

Create a network with an IP range:
docker network create --subnet 10.1.0.0/16 --gateway 10.1.0.1 \
--ip-range=10.1.4.0/24 --driver=bridge --label=host4network br04

Inspect the br04 network:
docker network inspect br04

Create a container using the br04 network:
docker container run --name network-test01 -it --network br04 centos /bin/bash

Install Net Tools:
yum update -y
yum install -y net-tools

Get the IP info for the container:
ifconfig

Get the gateway info the container:
netstat -rn

Get the DNS info for the container:
cat /etc/resolv.conf

Assigning IPs to a container:
Create a new container and assign an IP to it:
docker container run -d --name network-test02 --ip 10.1.4.102 --network br04 nginx

Get the IP info for the container:
docker container inspect network-test02 | grep IPAddr

Inspect network-test03 to see that br01 was removed:
docker container inspect network-test04

Networking two containers
Create an internal network:
docker network create -d bridge --internal localhost

Create a MySQL container that is connected to localhost:
docker container run -d --name test_mysql \
-e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=P4sSw0rd0 \
--network localhost mysql:5.7

Create a container that can ping the MySQL container:
docker container run -it --name ping-mysql \
--network bridge --network localhost \
centos

Create a container that can't ping the MySQL container:
docker container run -it --name cant-ping-mysql \
centos

Create a Nginx container that is not publicly accessible:
docker container run -d --name private-nginx -p 8081:80 --network localhost nginx

Inspect private-nginx:
docker container inspect private-nginx

docker network create --subnet 10.1.0.0/24 --gateway 10.1.0.1 br02
docker netowrk ls
ifconfig
docker network inspect
docker container rm <containerID>
docker network prune
docker network ls
docker network create --subnet 10.1.0.0/16 --gateway 10.1.0.1 \
--ip-range=10.1.4.0/24 --driver=bridge --label=host4network br04
docker network ls
docker network inspect br04
docker container run --name network-test01 -it --network br04 centos /bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y net-tools
ifconfig
netstat -rn
cat /etc/resolv.conf
ping google.com
exit
docker container run -d --name network-test02 --ip 10.1.4.102 --network br04 nginx
docker container inspect network-test02 | grep IPAddr
docker network create -d bridge --internal localhost
docker container run -d --name test_mysql \
-e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=P4sSw0rd0 \
--network localhost mysql:5.7
docker container run -it ping-mysql \
--network bridge --network localhost \
centos
ping test_mysql
docker container run -it --name cant-ping-mysql centos
ping test_mysql -> doesnt work since they are not on the same network
exit
docker container run -d --name private-nginx -p 8081:80 --network localhost nginx
curl localhost:8081 - doesnt return because network is internal, not bound to anything on docker host
docker inspect private-nginx
curl ip of container and get result back

Hands-On Lab - Docker Networking
Create a bridge network called frontend that will be publicly accessible.
Create a second bridge network called localhost that will be internal.
Deploy a MySQL container called database that will use the localhost network. Use the mysql 5.7 image:

Use the -e flag to set MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD to P4sSw0rd0.
The MySQL container should run in the background.
Next, deploy a second container call frontend-app and publish port 80 on the host to port 80 on the container.
The container will be attached to both of the frontend networks. Use the latest Nginx image.
The Nginx container should run in the background.

Once the Nginx container is created, connect it to the localhost network.

Create the frontend network
Use the docker network to create the frontend network:
docker network create frontend

Create the localhost network
User the docker network command to create the localhost network:
docker network create localhost --internal

Create a MySQL container
Create a MySQL container that is attached to the localhost network:
docker container run -d --name database --network localhost -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=P4ssW0rd0! mysql:5.7

Create an Nginx container
Create an Nginx container that is attached to the localhost network:
docker container run -d --name frontend-app --network frontend nginx:latest

Connect frontend-app container to the localhost network:
docker network connect localhost frontend-app

Connect frontend-app to the internal network
Connect 'frontend-app' to the 'localhost' network.
docker network connect localhost frontend-app

Storage Overview
In this lesson, we will look a how Docker handles storage for persistent and non-persistent data.

Docker Storage 101
Categories of data storage:
Non-persistent
Local storage
Data that is ephemeral
Every container has it
Tied to the lifecycle of the contain
Persistent
Volumes
Volumes are decoupled from containers

Non-persistent Data
Non-persistent data:
By default all container use local storage
Storage locations:
Linux: /var/lib/docker/[STORAGE-DRIVER]/
Windows: C:\ProgramData\Docker\windowsfilter\
Storage Drivers:
RHEL uses overlay2.
Ubuntu uses overlay2 or aufs.
SUSE uses btrfs.
Windows uses its own.

Persistent Data Using Volumes
Volumes:
Use a volume for persistent data:
Create the volume first, then create your container.
Mounted to a directory in the container
Data is written to the volume
Deleting a container does not delete the volume
First-class citizens
Uses the local driver

Third party drivers:
Block storage
File storage
Object storage

Storage locations:
Linux: /var/lib/docker/volumes/
Windows: C:\ProgramData\Docker\volumes

Volume Commands
Volumes are the preferred method of maintaining persistent data in Docker.
In this lesson, we will begin learning how to use the volume subcommand to list, create, and remove volumes.

Volume Basics
List all Docker volume commands:
docker volume -h

create: Create a volume.
inspect: Display detailed information on one or more volumes.
ls: List volumes.
prune: Remove all unused local volumes.
rm: Remove one or more volumes.

List all volumes on a host:
docker volume ls

Create two new volumes:
docker volume create test-volume1
docker volume create test-volume2

Get the flags available when creating a volume:
docker volume create -h

Inspecting a volume:
docker volume inspect test-volume1

Deleting a volume:
docker volume rm test-volume

Removing all unused volumes:
docker volume prune

Using Bind Mounts
Bind mounts have been around since the early days of Docker.
They have limited functionality compared to volumes.
With bind mount, a file or directory on the host machine is mounted into a container.

Volumes use a new directory that is created within Docker’s storage directory on the host machine,
and Docker manages that directory’s contents.

Using the mount flag:
mkdir target

docker container run -d \
  --name nginx-bind-mount1 \
  --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/target,target=/app \
  nginx
docker container ls

Bind mounts won't show up when listing volumes:
docker volume ls

Inspect the container to find the bind mount:
docker container inspect nginx-bind-mount1

Create a new file in /app on the container:

docker container exec -it nginx-bind-mount1 /bin/bash
cd target
touch file1.txt
ls
exit
Using the volume flag:

docker container run -d \
 --name nginx-bind-mount2 \
 -v "$(pwd)"/target2:/app \
 nginx
Create /app/file3.txt in the container:

docker container exec -it nginx-bind-mount2 touch /app/file3.txt
ls target2
Create an nginx.conf file:

mkdir nginx
cat << EOF >  nginx/nginx.conf
user  nginx;
worker_processes  1;

error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log warn;
pid        /var/run/nginx.pid;


events {
    worker_connections  1024;
}


http {
    include       /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;

    log_format  main  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                      '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                      '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';

    access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log  main;

    sendfile        on;
    #tcp_nopush     on;

    keepalive_timeout  65;

    #gzip  on;

    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
}
EOF
Create an Nginx container that creates a bind mount to nginx.conf:

docker container run -d \
 --name nginx-bind-mount3 \
 -v "$(pwd)"/nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf \
 nginx
Look at the bind mount by inspecting the container:

docker container inspect nginx-bind-mount3

Using Volumes for Persistent Storage
In this lesson, we will take a deeper look into using volumes with our Docker containers. Volumes are the preferred method for maintaining persistent data.

Volumes are easier to back up or migrate than bind mounts. You can manage volumes using Docker CLI commands or the Docker API. They work on both Linux and Windows containers. Volumes can be more safely shared among multiple containers. Volume drivers allow for:

Storing volumes on remote hosts or cloud providers
Encrypting the contents of volumes
Add other functionality
New volumes can have their content pre-populated by a container.

Create a new volume for an Nginx container:
docker volume create html-volume

Creating a volume using that volume mount:
docker container run -d \
 --name nginx-volume1 \
 --mount type=volume,source=html-volume,target=/usr/share/nginx/html/ \
 nginx

Inspect the volume:
docker volume inspect html-volume

List the contents of html-volume:
sudo ls /var/lib/docker/volumes/html-volume/_data

Creating a volume using that volume flag:
docker container run -d \
 --name nginx-volume2 \
 -v html-volume:/usr/share/nginx/html/ \
 nginx

Edit index.html:
sudo vi /var/lib/docker/volumes/html-volume/_data/index.html

Inspect nginx-volume2 to get the private IP:
docker container inspect nginx-volume2

Login into nginx-volume1 and go to the html directory:
docker container exec -it nginx-volume1 /bin/bash
cd /usr/share/nginx/html
cat index.hml

Install Vim:
apt-get update -y
apt-get install vim -y

Using a readonly volume:
docker run -d \
  --name=nginx-volume3 \
  --mount source=html-volume,target=/usr/share/nginx/html,readonly \
  nginx

Login into nginx-volume3 and go to the html directory:
docker container exec -it nginx-volume3 /bin/bash
cd /usr/share/nginx/html
cat index.hml

Install Vim:
apt-get update -y
apt-get install vim -y

Hands-On Lab - Docker Volumes
Create a volume called mysql_data, then deploy a MySQL database called app-database.
Use the mysql latest image, and use the -e flag to set MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD to P4sSw0rd0.
Use the mount flag to mount the mysql_data volume to /var/lib/mysql. The container should run in the background.

Create a Volume Called `mysql_data`
Use the docker volume command to create a volume called mysql_data.

[cloud_user@host]$ docker volume create mysql_data
Create a MySQL Container
Use the docker container command to create a MySQL container:

[cloud_user@host]$ docker container run -d --name app-database \
 --mount type=volume,source=mysql_data,target=/var/lib/mysql \
 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=P4ssW0rd0! \
 mysql:latest

Introduction to the Dockerfile
In this lesson we will start learning about building images using a Dockerfile.

What is the Dockerfile?
Dockerfiles are instructions. They contains all of the commands used to build an image.

Docker images consist of read-only layers.
Each represents a Dockerfile instruction.
Layers are stacked.
Each layer is a result of the changes from the previous layer.
Images are built using the docker image build command.
Dockerfile Layers
Dockerfile:
FROM ubuntu:15.04
COPY . /app
RUN make /app
CMD python /app/app.py
FROM creates a layer from the ubuntu:15.04 Docker image.
COPY adds files from your Docker client’s current directory.
RUN builds your application with make.
CMD specifies what command to run within the container.

Best Practices
General guidelines:
Keep containers as ephemeral as possible.
Follow Principle 6 of the 12 Factor App.
Avoid including unnecessary files.
Use .dockerignore.
Use multi-stage builds.
Don’t install unnecessary packages.
Decouple applications.
Minimize the number of layers.
Sort multi-line arguments.
Leverage build cache.

Working with Instructions
FROM: Initializes a new build stage and sets the Base Image

RUN: Will execute any commands in a new layer

CMD: Provides a default for an executing container. There can only be one CMD instruction in a Dockerfile

LABEL: Adds metadata to an image

EXPOSE: Informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime

ENV: Sets the environment variable <key> to the value <value>

ADD: Copies new files, directories or remote file URLs from <src> and adds them to the filesystem of the image at the path <dest>.

COPY: Copies new files or directories from <src> and adds them to the filesystem of the container at the path <dest>.

ENTRYPOINT: Allows for configuring a container that will run as an executable

VOLUME: Creates a mount point with the specified name and marks it as holding externally mounted volumes from native host or other containers

USER: Sets the user name (or UID) and optionally the user group (or GID) to use when running the image and for any RUN, CMD, and ENTRYPOINT instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile

WORKDIR: Sets the working directory for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY, and ADD instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile

ARG: Defines a variable that users can pass at build-time to the builder with the docker build command, using the --build-arg <varname>=<value> flag

ONBUILD: Adds a trigger instruction to the image that will be executed at a later time, when the image is used as the base for another build

HEALTHCHECK: Tells Docker how to test a container to check that it is still working

SHELL: Allows the default shell used for the shell form of commands to be overridden

To set up the environment:
sudo yum install git -y
mkdir docker_images
cd docker_images
mkdir weather-app
cd weather-app
git clone https://github.com/linuxacademy/content-weather-app.git src

Create the Dockerfile:
vi Dockerfile

Dockerfile contents:
# Create an image for the weather-app
FROM node
LABEL org.label-schema.version=v1.1
RUN mkdir -p /var/node
ADD src/ /var/node/
WORKDIR /var/node
RUN npm install
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ./bin/www

Build the weather-app image:
docker image build -t linuxacademy/weather-app:v1 .

List the images:
docker image ls

Create the weather-app container:
docker container run -d --name weather-app1 -p 8081:3000 linuxacademy/weather-app:v1

List all running containers:
docker container ls

ADD or Copy https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#add-or-copy

Environment Variables
To make new software easier to run, you can use ENV to update the PATH environment variable for the software that your container installs.

Setup your environment:
cd docker_images
mkdir env
cd env
Use the --env flag to pass an environment variable when building an image:
--env [KEY]=[VALUE]

Use the ENV instruction in the Dockerfile:
ENV [KEY]=[VALUE]
ENV [KEY] [VALUE]

Clone the weather-app:
git clone https://github.com/linuxacademy/content-weather-app.git src

Create the Dockerfile
vi Dockerfile

Dockerfile contents:
# Create an image for the weather-app
FROM node
LABEL org.label-schema.version=v1.1
ENV NODE_ENV="development"
ENV PORT 3000

RUN mkdir -p /var/node
ADD src/ /var/node/
WORKDIR /var/node
RUN npm install
EXPOSE $PORT
CMD ./bin/www

Create the weather-app container:
docker image build -t linuxacademy/weather-app:v2 .

Inspect the container to see the environment variables:
docker image inspect linuxacademy/weather-app:v2

Deploy the weather-dev application:
docker container run -d --name weather-dev -p 8082:3001 --env PORT=3001 linuxacademy/weather-app:v2

Inspect the development container to see the environment variables:
docker container inspect weather-dev

Deploy the weather-app to production:
docker container run -d --name weather-app2 -p 8083:3001 --env PORT=3001 --env NODE_ENV=production linuxacademy/weather-app:v2

Inspect the production container to see the environment variables:
docker container inspect weather-app2

Get the logs for weather-app2:
docker container logs weather-app2

docker container run -d --name weather-prod -p 8084:3000 --env NODE_ENV=production linuxacademy/weather-app:v2

Build Arguments
In this lesson, we will explore using build arguments to paramerterize an image build.

Use the --build-arg flag when building an image:
--build-arg [NAME]=[VALUE]

Use the ARG instruction in the Dockerfile:
ARG [NAME]=[DEFAULT_VALUE]

Navigate to the args directory:
cd docker_images
mkdir args
cd args

Clone the weather-app:
git clone https://github.com/linuxacademy/content-weather-app.git src

Create the Dockerfile:
vi Dockerfile

Dockerfile:
# Create an image for the weather-app
FROM node
LABEL org.label-schema.version=v1.1
ARG SRC_DIR=/var/node

RUN mkdir -p $SRC_DIR
ADD src/ $SRC_DIR
WORKDIR $SRC_DIR
RUN npm install
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ./bin/www

Create the weather-app container:
docker image build -t linuxacademy/weather-app:v3 --build-arg SRC_DIR=/var/code .

Inspect the image:
docker image inspect linuxacademy/weather-app:v3 | grep WorkingDir

Create the weather-app container:
docker container run -d --name weather-app3 -p 8085:3000 linuxacademy/weather-app:v3

Verify that the container is working by executing curl:
curl localhost:8085

Working with Non-privileged Users
In this lesson, you will learn how to use the USER instruction to create a non-privileged user.
Rather than using root, we can use a non-privileged user to configure and run an application.

Setup your environment:
cd docker_images
mkdir non-privileged-user
cd non-privileged-user

Create the Dockerfile:
vi Dockerfile

Dockerfile contents:

# Creates a CentOS image that uses cloud_user as a non-privileged user
FROM centos:latest
RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash cloud_user
USER cloud_user

Build the new image:
docker image build -t centos7/nonroot:v1 .

Create a container using the new image:
docker container run -it --name test-build centos7/nonroot:v1 /bin/bash

Connecting as a privileged user:
docker container start test-build
docker container exec -u 0 -it test-build /bin/bash

Set up the environment:
cd ~/docker_images
mkdir node-non-privileged-user
cd node-non-privileged-user

Create the Dockerfile:
vi Dockerfile

Dockerfile contents:
# Create an image for the weather-app
FROM node
LABEL org.label-schema.version=v1.1
RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash node_user
USER node_user
ADD src/ /home/node_user
WORKDIR /home/node_user
RUN npm install
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ./bin/www
git clone https://github.com/linuxacademy/content-weather-app.git src

Build the weather-app image using the non-privileged user node_user:
docker image build -t linuxacademy/weather-app-nonroot:v1 .

Create a container using the linuxacademy/weather-app-nonroot:v1 image:
docker container run -d --name weather-app-nonroot -p 8086:3000 linuxacademy/weather-app-nonroot:v1

Order of Execution
This lesson focuses on the order that instructions are executed in when building an image.
Some instructions may have unintended consequences that can cause your build to fail.

Setup your environment:
cd docker_images
mkdir centos-conf
cd centos-conf

Create the Dockerfile:
vi Dockerfile

Dockerfile contents:
# Creates a CentOS image that uses cloud_user as a non-privileged user
FROM centos:latest
RUN mkdir -p ~/new-dir1
RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash cloud_user
USER cloud_user
RUN mkdir -p ~/new-dir2
RUN mkdir -p /etc/myconf
RUN echo "Some config data" >> /etc/myconf/my.conf

Build the new image:
docker image build -t centos7/myconf:v1 .

Using the Volume Instruction
In this lesson, we will use the VOLUME instruction to automatically create a mount point in a Docker image.
When a container is created using this image, a volume will be created and mounted to the specified directory.

Set up your environment:
cd docker_images
mkdir volumes
cd volumes

Create the Dockerfile:
vi Dockerfile

Build an Nginx image that uses a volume:
FROM nginx:latest
VOLUME ["/usr/share/nginx/html/"]

Build the new image:
docker image build -t linuxacademy/nginx:v1 .

Create a new container using the linuxacademy/nginx:v1 image:
docker container run -d --name nginx-volume linuxacademy/nginx:v1

Inspect nginx-volume:
docker container inspect nginx-volume

List the volumes:
docker volume ls | grep [VOLUME_NAME]

Inspect the volumes:
docker volume inspect [VOLUME_NAME]

Entrypoint vs. Command
In this lesson, we will begin working with the ENTRYPOINT instruction. Though ENTRYPOINT functions very similarly to CMD it's behaviors are vary different.

ENTRYPOINT allows us to configure a container that will run as an executable.
We can override all elements specified using CMD.
Using the docker run --entrypoint flag will override the ENTRYPOINT instruction.

Setup your environment:
cd docker_images
mkdir entrypoint
cd entrypoint

Create the Dockerfile:
vi Dockerfile

Dockerfile contents:
# Create an image for the weather-app
FROM node
LABEL org.label-schema.version=v1.1
ENV NODE_ENV="production"
ENV PORT 3001
RUN mkdir -p /var/node
ADD src/ /var/node/
WORKDIR /var/node
RUN npm install
EXPOSE $PORT
ENTRYPOINT ./bin/www

Clone the image:
git clone https://github.com/linuxacademy/content-weather-app.git src

Build the image:
docker image build -t linuxacademy/weather-app:v4 .

Deploy the weather-app:
docker container run -d --name weather-app4 linuxacademy/weather-app:v4

Inspect weather-app4:
docker container inspect weather-app4 | grep Cmd
docker container inspect weather-app-nonroot
docker container inspect weather-app4

Create the weather-app container:
docker container run -d --name weather-app5 -p 8083:3001 linuxacademy/weather-app:v4 echo "Hello World"

Inspect weather-app5:
docker container inspect weather-app5

Create the volumes for Prometheus:
docker volume create prometheus
docker volume create prometheus_data

sudo chown -R nfsnobody:nfsnobody /var/lib/docker/volumes/prometheus/
sudo chown -R nfsnobody:nfsnobody /var/lib/docker/volumes/prometheus_data/

Create the Prometheus container:
docker run --name prometheus -d -p 8084:9090 \
  -v prometheus:/etc/prometheus \
  -v prometheus_data:/prometheus/data \
  prom/prometheus \
  --config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
  --storage.tsdb.path=/prometheus/data

Inspect Prometheus:
docker container inspect prometheus

Prometheus Dockerfile https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/master/Dockerfile

Using .dockerignore
In this lesson, we'll create a .dockerignore file, so that we can exclude files we don't want copied over when building an image.

Setup your environment:

cd docker_images
mkdir dockerignore
cd dockerignore
git clone https://github.com/linuxacademy/content-weather-app.git src
cd src
git checkout dockerignore
cd ../
Create the .dockerignore file:

vi .dockerignore
Add the following to .dockerignore:

# Ignore these files
*/*.md
*/.git
src/docs/
*/tests/
Create the Dockerfile:

vi Dockerfile
Dockerfile contents:

# Create an image for the weather-app
FROM node
LABEL org.label-schema.version=v1.1
ENV NODE_ENV="production"
ENV PORT 3000

RUN mkdir -p /var/node
ADD src/ /var/node/
WORKDIR /var/node
RUN npm install
EXPOSE $PORT
ENTRYPOINT ["./bin/www"]

Build the image:
docker image build -t linuxacademy/weather-app:v5 .

Create the weather-app container:
docker container run -d --name weather-app-ignore linuxacademy/weather-app:v5

List the contents of /var/node:
docker container exec weather-app-ignore ls -la /var/node

Building Images
In this lesson, we will learn some alternate ways of building images.
To build one:
docker image build -t <NAME>:<TAG> .

Useful flags:
-f, --file string: This is the name of the Dockerfile (Default is PATH/Dockerfile).
--force-rm: Always remove intermediate containers.
--label list: Set metadata for an image.
--rm: Remove intermediate containers after a successful build (default is true).
--ulimit ulimit: This sets ulimit options (default is []).
cd docker_images/weather-app
cp Dockerfile Dockerfile.test
docker image build -t linuxacademy/weather-app:path-example1 -f Dockerfile.test .
docker image build -t linuxacademy/weather-app:path-example2 --label com.linuxacademy.version=v1.8 -f Dockerfile.test .

Building image by piping the Dockerfile through STDIN:
docker image build -t <NAME>:<TAG> -<<EOF
Build instructions
EOF

Example:
docker image build -t linuxacademy/nginx:stind --rm -<<EOF
FROM nginx:latest
VOLUME ["/usr/share/nginx/html/"]
EOF

Building an image using a URL:
docker image build -t <NAME>:<TAG> <GIT_URL>#<REF>
docker image build -t <NAME>:<TAG> <GIT_URL>#:<DIRECTORY>
docker image build -t <NAME>:<TAG> <GIT_URL>#<REF>:<DIRECTORY>

Example:
docker image build -t linuxacademy/weather-app:github https://github.com/linuxacademy/content-weather-app.git#remote-build

Building an image from a zip file:
docker image build -t <NAME>:<TAG> - < <FILE>.tar.gz

Example:
cd docker_images
mkdir tar_image
cd tar_image
git clone https://github.com/linuxacademy/content-weather-app.git
cd content-weather-app
git checkout remote-build
tar -zcvf weather-app.tar.gz Dockerfile src
docker image build -t linuxacademy/weather-app:from-tar - < weather-app.tar.gz

Using Multi-Stage Builds
In this lesson, we will learn how to build smaller images using multi-stage builds.
By default, the stages are not named
Stages are numbered with integers
Starting with 0 for the first FROM instruction
Name the stage by adding as to the FROM instruction
Reference the stage name in the COPY instruction

Set up your environment:
cd docker_images
mkdir multi-stage-builds
cd multi-stage-builds
git clone https://github.com/linuxacademy/content-weather-app.git src

Create the Dockerfile:
vi Dockerfile

Dockerfile contents:

# Create an image for the weather-app using multi-stage build
FROM node AS build
RUN mkdir -p /var/node/
ADD src/ /var/node/
WORKDIR /var/node
RUN npm install

FROM node:alpine
ARG VERSION=V1.1
LABEL org.label-schema.version=$VERSION
ENV NODE_ENV="production"
COPY --from=build /var/node /var/node
WORKDIR /var/node
EXPOSE 3000
ENTRYPOINT ["./bin/www"]

Build the image:
docker image build -t linuxacademy/weather-app:multi-stage-build --rm --build-arg VERSION=1.5 .

List images to see the size difference:
docker image ls

Create the weather-app container:
docker container run -d --name multi-stage-build -p 8087:3000 linuxacademy/weather-app:multi-stage-build

Tagging
In this lesson, we will talk about how to use the tag command, and best practices to keep in mind when tagging.

Add a name and an optional tag with -t or --tag, in the name:tag format:
docker image build -t <name>:<tag>
docker image build --tag <name>:<tag>

List your images:
docker image ls

Use our Git commit hash as the image tag:
git log -1 --pretty=%H

Use the Docker tag to a create a new tagged image:
docker tag <SOURCE_IMAGE><:TAG> <TARGET_IMAGE>:<TAG>

Get the commit hash:
cd docker_images/weather-app/src
git log -1 --pretty=%H
cd ../

Build the image using the Git hash as the tag:
docker image build -t linuxacademy/weather-app:<GIT_HASH> .

Tag the weather-app as the latest using the image tagged with the commit hash:
docker image tag linuxacademy/weather-app:<GIT_HASH> linuxacademy/weather-app:latest

Distributing Images on Docker Hub
In this lesson, we'll walk through how to tag and push an image to Docker Hub. You will need a Docker Hub account.

Create a Docker Hub account:
https://hub.docker.com/

Docker Push:
docker image push <USERNAME>/<IMAGE_NAME>:<TAG>

Creating an image for Docker Hub:
docker image tag <IMAGE_NAME>:<TAG> <linuxacademy>/<IMAGE_NAME>:<TAG>

Set up your environment:
cd docker_images
mkdir dockerhub
cd dockerhub

Create the Dockerfile:
vi Dockerfile

Dockerfile contents:
# Create an image for the weather-app using multi-stage build
FROM node AS build
RUN mkdir -p /var/node/
ADD src/ /var/node/
WORKDIR /var/node
RUN npm install

FROM node:alpine
ARG VERSION=V1.1
LABEL org.label-schema.version=$VERSION
ENV NODE_ENV="production"
COPY --from=build /var/node /var/node
WORKDIR /var/node
EXPOSE 3000
ENTRYPOINT ["./bin/www"]

Git the weather-app code:
git clone https://github.com/linuxacademy/content-weather-app.git src

Use the Git commit hash as the image tag:
cd src
git log -1 --pretty=%H
cd ../

Build the image:
docker image build -t <USERNAME>/weather-app:<HASH> --build-arg VERSION=1.5 .

Tag the image before pushing it to Docker Hub:
docker image tag linuxacademy/weather-app:<HASH> <USERNAME>/weather-app:<HASH>

Push the image to Docker Hub:
docker login
docker image push <USERNAME>/weather-app:<HASH>

Tag the latest image:
docker image tag <USERNAME>/weather-app:<HASH> <USERNAME>/weather-app:latest

Push the latest image to Docker Hub:
docker login <USERNAME>
docker image push <USERNAME>/weather-app:latest

Hands-On Lab: Creating Images Using a Dockerfile
In the /home/cloud_user/ directory, you will find the weather-app. Navigate to it. In that directory you will find the source code to the weather-app in src.

Create the Dockerfile
Create a Dockerfile that will use a multi-stage build. The first stage will use node as the base image, and will be called source.
Create a directory for the source code: /node/weather-app.

Add the code from src to /node/weather-app on the image.
Set /node/weather-app as the working directory.
Execute an npm install to install the dependencies.
The second stage will use node:alpine as the base image.
Create an argument called APP_VERSION that will set the version of the application.
Set an environment variable called NODE_ENV and set it to development.
Copy /node/weather-app from the source build stage to /var/weather-app.
Set /var/weather-app as the working directory. Expose port 3000. Set ./bin/www as the entrypoint.

FROM node AS source
RUN mkdir -p /node/weather-app
ADD src/ /node/weather-app
WORKDIR /node/weather-app
RUN npm install

FROM node:alpine
ARG APP_VERSION=V1.1
LABEL org.label-schema.version=$APP_VERSION
ENV NODE_ENV="production"
COPY --from=source /node/weather-app /node/weather-app
WORKDIR /node/weather-app
EXPOSE 3000
ENTRYPOINT ["./bin/www"]

Build the weather-app image
Name the image <USERNAME>/weather-app
In the src directory, execute git log -1 --pretty=%H to get the commit hash.
Use the commit hash as the tag when you execute the image build.
Using the build argument, flag set APP_VERSION to v1.5.
Make sure that all intermediate images are deleted when the build completes.

Use Git commit hash as the image tag:
cd src
git log -1 --pretty=%H
cd ../

Build the image:
sudo docker image build -t linuxacademy/weather-app:[HASH] --build-arg VERSION=1.5 .

Deploy a test container using the image.
Create a container called weather-app using the image you just built, and run it as a background process.
Publish port 8080 to 3000 on the container.
Set the NODE_ENV environment variable to production.
Execute curl localhost:8080 to test the container.

Create the weather-app container:
sudo docker container run -d --name weather-app -p 8080:3000 linuxacademy/weather-app:<HASH>

Hands-On Lab: Tagging and Pushing Images to Docker Hub
At the command line, login into Docker Hub.
Navigate to the src directory in weather-app.
Execute git log -1 --pretty=%H to get the commit hash.
Drop back down to the weather-app directory.
Build the image and tag it with [USERNAME]/my-weather-app:[COMMIT_HASH]. You will need to set the VERSION build argument and set it to 1.5.
Then tag it as latest. Push both images to Docker Hub.

Log in to Docker Hub
Login to Docker Hub:
[cloud_user@host]$ docker login

Get the Git Commit Hash
Use Git commit hash as the image tag:
cd weather-app
cd src
git log -1 --pretty=%H
cd ../

Build the `weather-app` Image
Build the image:
[cloud_user@host]$ docker image build -t [USERNAME]/weather-app:[HASH] --build-arg VERSION=1.5 .

Tag the image to latest:
[cloud_user@host]$ docker image tag [USERNAME]/weather-app:[HASH] [USERNAME]/weather-app:latest

Push Both Images to Docker Hub
Push both images to Docker Hub:
docker image push [USERNAME]/weather-app:[HASH]
docker image push [USERNAME]/weather-app:latest

Image History
In this lesson, see how to get more information about an image by looking at its history.

Show the history of an image:
docker image history <IMAGE>
docker image history --no-trunc <IMAGE>
docker image history --quiet <IMAGE>
docker image history --quiet --no-trunc <IMAGE>

Get the image history for Node:
docker image history node:latest

Get the image history for weather-app:
docker image history rivethead42/weather-app:latest

Get the image history weather-app:v1 with the no-truncm flag:
docker image history --no-trunc linuxacademy/weather-app:v1

Save the output using the no-truncm flag to a file:
docker image history --no-trunc linuxacademy/weather-app:v1 > output.txt

View the contents:
vi output.txt

Use the quiet flag to list the image IDs:
docker image history --quiet linuxacademy/weather-app:v1

Use the quiet flag to list the image IDs, then save the output to a file using the no-truncm flag:
docker image history --quiet --no-trunc linuxacademy/weather-app:v1

Saving and Loading Images
In this lesson, we will learn how to save an image to a tar file, and see how to load it back in.

Save one or more images to a tar file:
docker image save <IMAGE> > <FILE>.tar
docker image save <IMAGE> -o <FILE>.tar
docker image save <IMAGE> --output <FILE>.tar

Load an image from a tar file:
docker image load < <FILE>.tar
docker image load -i <FILE>.tar
docker image load --input <FILE>.tar

Setup:
mkdir output
cd output

Archive the rivethead42/weather-app:latest image:
docker image save rivethead42/weather-app:latest --output weather-app-latest.tar

Inspect the tar file:
tar tvf weather-app-latest.tar

Compress the tar file:
gzip weather-app-latest.tar

Delete the image:
docker image rm [USERNAME]/weather-app:latest

Load the weather-app image from a tar file:
docker image load --input weather-app-latest.tar.gz
docker image ls | grep [USERNAME]/weather-app
docker image rm rivethead42/weather-app:latest docker image ls | grep rivethead42/weather-app

Beyond Docker Basics
Container Management
In this lesson, we'll take a look at a few ways we can examine the running processes in a container.

Docker Top:
docker container top <NAME>

Docker Stats:
docker container stats <NAME>

Create a new CentOS container:
docker container run -itd --name container_process centos /bin/bash

Execute docker container top:
docker container top container_process

Attach to container_process:
docker container exec -it container_process /bin/bash

Attach to the container using attach:
docker container attach container_process

Restart the container:
docker container start container_process

Attach to the container_process container:
docker container exec -it container_process /bin/bash

Run top on the container:
top
exit

Get stats on a container:
docker container stats container_process

Having Containers Start Automatically
In this lesson, we will look at how to set restart policies for containers,
and how that will effect their behavior when the docker service is restarted.

To configure the restart policy for a container, use the --restart flag:
no: Do not automatically restart the container. (the default)
on-failure: Restart the container if it exits due to an error, which manifests as a non-zero exit code.
always: Always restart the container if it stops.
unless-stopped: Similar to always, except that when the container is stopped, it is not restarted even after the Docker daemon restarts.

Automatically Restarting a container:
docker container run -d --name <NAME> --restart <RESTART> <IMAGE>

Make sure a container always restarts:
docker container run -d --name always-restart --restart always rivethead42/weather-app:latest

Make sure a container restarts unless it's stopped:
docker container run -d --name unless-stopped --restart unless-stopped rivethead42/weather-app:latest

Stop and restart your Docker service:
sudo systemctl restart docker

List your containers:
docker container ls

Stop the unless-stopped container:
docker container stop unless-stopped

Stop and restart your Docker service:
sudo systemctl restart docker

List your containers:
docker container ls

Stop the unless-stopped container:
docker container stop always-restart

Stop and restart your Docker service:
sudo systemctl restart docker

List your containers:
docker container ls

Docker Events
In this lesson, we'll see how to listen for events using the events command.

Get real-time events from the server:
docker system events
docker system events --since '<TIME_PERIOD>'

Start a new CentOS container:
docker container run -itd --name docker_events centos /bin/bash

Listen for events:
docker system events

Generate Events:
docker container exec docker_events /bin/bash
docker container attach docker_events
docker container start docker_events

Filters Events:
docker system events --filter <FILTER_NAME>=<FILTER>

Filter for container events:
docker system events --filter type=container --since '1h'

Generate an event:
docker container exec docker_events ls /

Filter for container events:
docker system events --filter type=container --filter event=start --since '1h'

List / on docker_events:
docker container exec docker_events ls /

Filter for attach events:
docker system events --filter type=container --filter event=attach

Connect to docker_events using /bin/bash:
docker container exec -it docker_events /bin/bash

Attach to docker_events:
docker container attach docker_events

Connect to docker_events using /bin/bash:
docker container exec -it docker_events /bin/bash

Attach to docker_events:
docker container attach docker_events

Use multiple filters:
docker system events --filter type=container --filter event=attach --filter event=die --filter event=stop

Start docker_events:
docker container start docker_events

Attach to docker_events:
docker container attach docker_events

Documentation:
docker events https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/events/
Engine API v1.24 https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.24/

Managing Stopped Container
In this lesson, we will manage stopped containers by starting, deleting, or pruning them.

Remove one or more containers:
docker container rm <NAME>

List the rm flags:
docker container rm -h

Start one or more stopped containers:
docker container start <NAME>

Remove all stopped containers:
docker container prune

List the IDs of all containers:
docker container ls -a -q

List all stopped containers:
docker container ls -a -f status=exited

List the IDs of stopped containers:
docker container ls -a -q -f status=exited

Get a count of all stopped containers:
docker container ls -a -q -f status=exited | wc -l

Get a listing of our containers:
docker container ls -a -f status=exited | grep prometheus

Start Prometheus:
docker container start prometheus

Find stopped weather-app containers with grep:
docker container ls -a -f status=exited | grep weather-app

Remove stopped weather-app containers:
docker container rm [CONTAINER_IDS]

Prune all stopped containers:
docker container prune

Managing Docker with Portainer
In this lesson, we'll install Portainer and use it manage our Docker host.
portainer.io

Create a volume for Portainers data:
docker volume create portainer_data

Create the Portainers container:
docker container run -d --name portainer -p 8080:9000 \
--restart=always \
-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
-v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer

Go to public ip of docker container port 8080,
set up account and select local.
UI for doing docker stuff.

docker container ls

The ls should output:
rivethead42/weather-app:latest
NODE_ENV production

Updating Containers with Watchtower
In this lesson, we'll see how to use Watchtower to keep a container up-to-date when its image gets updated.

Clone Express app:
git clone https://github.com/linuxacademy/content-express-demo-app.git watchtower
cd watchtower
git checkout dockerfile

Build the Docker image:
docker login -u [USERNAME]
docker image build -t rivethead42/my-express .
docker image push rivethead42/my-express

Create the container:
docker container run -d --name watched-app -p 80:3000 --restart always rivethead42/my-express

Create Watchtower:
docker container run -d --name watchtower \
--restart always \
-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
v2tec/watchtower -i 15

Add a .dockerignore file:
vi .dockerignore

.dockerignore contents:
Dockerfile
.git
.gitignore

Edit app.js and add a comment:
vi app.js

app.js contents:
//This is a comment
//
...

Add the file newfile.js:
touch newfile.js

Rebuild the image:
docker image build -t rivethead42/my-express --no-cache .
docker image push rivethead42/my-express

Check to see if the container was restarted with the new image:
docker container ls

Verify the changes by attaching to watched-app:
docker container exec -it watched-app /bin/bash

Hands-On Lab: Managing Docker with Portainer
Additional Information and Resources

Create the volume:
Create a new volume called portainer_data.

Create the Portainer Container:
Next create a new container called portainer.
Make sure that the container runs in the background.
Map port 8080 to 9000 on the container.
Make sure the restart policy is set to always.
Create a bind mount that maps var/run/docker.sock to var/run/docker.sock on the container.
Also map portainer_data to /data on the container.
Use portainer/portainer as the image.

Create a Container from Portainer
Goto [LAB_IP]:8080. Create your account.
Select Local and click Connect.
Click on your local Docker host.
Next click on Container and then Add container.
Name the container lab_nginx.
Map port 8081 to 80 on the container.

Docker Compose
Installing Docker Compose
In this lesson, we will learn about installing Docker Compose and why we should use it.

Download the latest version of Docker Compose:
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Apply executable permissions:
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Test Docker Compose:
docker-compose --version

Compose Commands
In this lesson, we will start using compose by creating a compose file.
Then we will create and manage the services by using the most commonly used commands:

build: Build or rebuild services
bundle: Generate a Docker bundle from the Compose file
config: Validate and view the Compose file
create: Create services
down: Stop and remove containers, networks, images, and volumes
events: Receive real time events from containers
exec: Execute a command in a running container
help: Get help on a command
images: List images
kill: Kill containers
logs: View output from containers
pause: Pause services
port: Print the public port for a port binding
ps: List containers
pull: Pull service images
push: Push service images
restart: Restart services
rm: Remove stopped containers
run: Run a one-off command
scale: Set number of containers for a service
start: Start services
stop: Stop services
top: Display the running processes
unpause: Unpause services
up: Create and start containers
